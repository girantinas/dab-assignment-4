# Introduction

This file contains a list of the API endpoints that the server should respond to once it is completed. Use this as a guide if you aren't sure when specific functions should error or if you want more guidance for this assignment.

Before you read this, we encourage you to read over `api/api.go` and try to guess what the HTTP method for each function should be and why. Also think of any errors that could occur with the request. Once you do, come back and try to reason why we chose the specific HTTP methods for each endpoint.

### Definitions For This Assignment
- An **empty response** is an HTTP response with an empty body. It still has a status code. **UPDATE 4/11** We are also allowing an empty response to contain a newline character.
- An **invalid JSON for an endpoint** is a JSON that has bad syntax or at least one of the required keys for the endpoint has a value of the empty string when unmarshalled by Go. A JSON is **not** invalid if it has more keys than required by the endpoint (I.E. if an endpoint needs only needs a `username` and the request has a JSON with a `username` and `password`, the JSON is valid). **For all endpoints that require a JSON, if the given JSON is invalid or there is no JSON in the request, return an empty response with `400 Bad Request`.**
